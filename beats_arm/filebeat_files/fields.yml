    type: date
    description: 'Date/time when the event originated.

      This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
      the event was generated by the source.

      If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
      by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

      Required field for all events.'

    description: 'Custom key/value pairs.

      Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects.

    example:
      application: foo-bar

  - name: message
    level: core
    type: text
    description: 'For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized
      for viewing in a log viewer.

      For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated
      to form a human-readable summary of the event.

      If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.'

      shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer
      where the event happened or the measurement was taken.'
    footnote: 'Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat.
      For APM, it is the agent running in the app/service. The agent information does
      not change if data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing
      systems such as Logstash or APM Server.'

    title: Client
    group: 2
    description: 'A client is defined as the initiator of a network connection for
      events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

      For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends
      the SYN packet(s). For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator
      or requestor in the network transaction. Some systems use the term "originator"
      to refer the client in TCP connections. The client fields describe details about
      the system acting as the client in the network event. Client fields are usually
      populated in conjunction with server fields. Client fields are generally not
      populated for packet-level events.

      Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which
      is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls
      in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled
      appropriately.'
